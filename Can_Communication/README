2. The STM32 Runs on Embassy Rust.

3. Hardware used:
		- NUCLEO_G431RB
		- arduino due

## Build and Flash

You can build and flash your firmware using one of those tools:

- `cargo build --release` — builds the code
- `cargo run --release` — flash and run using `probe-rs run` runner or `probe-run` runner (deprecated) which you can set in `.cargo/config.toml`
- `cargo embed --release` — multifunctional tool for flash and debug
